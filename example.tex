    \opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

    Please find here the new class I designed to write my letters. Most of the classes I found were too complex, and followed an English layout.

    This class follows the layout of French formal letters.

    I must confess that this class is not completely feature full and bug-free. It will be enhanced when needed. In case you would like to contribute to it, please send me pull-requests or patches, and I'll be happy to merge them..

    \closing{Sincerely yours,}
